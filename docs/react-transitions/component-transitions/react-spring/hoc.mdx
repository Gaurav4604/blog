# Recipe 3

## Motivation

This section seems new, thats true, since we've already built our base components, we could very well take
these components, and build out a complex and interactive UI from it, and it would work. But its not optimal. The scoping we've
followed, shows how big our codebase can become, if we wanted to coordinate and control these animations to be in a flow.
This, is not ideal, and so we're gonna try to make our components into HOCs, the hard way, to gain the most knowledge possible, from it.

## Code Architecture

- Earlier when we built our components, it was a **one-track** process

  1.  we decided what animated properties our component needs
  2.  we used the right kind of animation controller to modify the required property
  3.  we assigned our component, those properties

and voila! we were done, as it turns out, this is suitable only in small projects or with isolated components.
In real-world projects, components usually _talk_ or _react_ to one another, and are supposed to follow the **SOLID** principles.

- We're gonna try to make our component feel as standalone as possible, while making it reusable (isn't **react** all about _reusability_?),
  this requires us to follow a very strategic yet interesting process

  1. Define what the base component is. (eg: it is a container that shrinks and grows)
  2. Define the parameters you want to be able to modify in the component, via props and refs (we will try to modify just about everything)
  3. implement the component using this design philosophy.

export function AnimateOnDemand() {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(true);
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button onClick={() => setAnimate(!animate)}>{`click to ${
        animate ? "shrink" : "grow"
      } the box`}</button>
      <div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />
      <ShrinkGrow expand={animate} />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

## What we're gonna be building (Part 1)

<AnimateOnDemand />
<br />

As a side-note, we'll be building our component using **typescript**,this will
mean making our component logic a bit more complex, but trust me, its better to
write it this way, in the long run.

## Code

```tsx
type Props = {
  expand?: boolean;
} & PropsWithChildren;

const ShrinkGrow = forwardRef(
  (props: Props, shrinkGrowRef: SpringRef<Lookup<any>>) => {
    const { scale } = useSpring({
      ref: shrinkGrowRef,
      from: {
        scale: props.expand ? 0 : 1,
      },
      to: {
        scale: props.expand ? 1 : 0,
      },
    });
    return (
      <animated.div
        style={{
          width: 80,
          background: "#ff6",
          height: 80,
          borderRadius: 8,
          scale,
        }}
      >
        {props.children}
      </animated.div>
    );
  }
);
export default ShrinkGrow;
```

### Code Breakdown

1. #### Props Defintion

```tsx
type Props = {
  expand?: boolean;
} & PropsWithChildren;
```

For people from the non-typescript world, this is just a static type declaration of what our props is allowed to accept, it helps with _linting_, prompts and
auto-completion. In our case, we're letting the user pass.

- expand (an abstract animation control via boolean)
- children (to allow our component to be a parent component for any components, this component needs to wrap)
- ref (this is defined by the `forwardRef`)

2. #### HOC wrapper

```tsx
const ShrinkGrow = forwardRef(
  (props: Props, shrinkGrowRef: SpringRef<Lookup<any>>) => {}
);
```

Since our component is meant to be a HOC, we need to wrap our functional component with a `forwardRef`, i.e. a **forwardRef renderFunction**, this helps pass down
a _reference_, via **props** we can use in our function component. <br/> (this is useful for tracking our component's animation state and/or trigger orchestrated animations). <br/>
[learn more about HOC and forwardRef here.](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef)

The type of ref we want to accept is a SpringRef (a special type of ref object defined by `react-spring`), this is because we want our animation controller to have
access to this **reference**, so that the **reference** can keep a track of the current animation process. <br/>
(but why? you will know soon enough)

3. #### Animation _definition_

```jsx
const { scale } = useSpring({
  ref: shrinkGrowRef,
  from: {
    scale: props.expand ? 0 : 1,
  },
  to: {
    scale: props.expand ? 1 : 0,
  },
});
```

The animation definition, for the most part, remains the same as the [first](./recipe-1#animation-control) and [second](./recipe-2#animation-control) recipe, except we're now **assigning a ref, to keep a track of this hook's state modification**,
as `ref: shrinkGrowRef`.
Everything else, remains exactly the same as the earlier recipes. (try converting [recipe 1](./recipe-1), to follow an HOC architecture)

## The Main Question!

We added a ref handle, but why? We could've easily controlled our animation via props, so why the ref?
As you know, refs are an _escape hatch_, from the react rules and system. This allows react-spring to control
animation properties, without having to define every property via `useSpring`, for each component. It also allows
**react-spring** to take control of the animation system over a larger set of components, and coordinate the
animations, to portray them in a way that we want, _without_ having to do a lot of **heavy lifting** ourselves.

## What we're gonna be building (Part 2)

Now that we have our components laid out in an HOC architecture, we're ready to use some more tools provided by react-spring, meant to make life easier,
while animating components using React. One such tool is going to be [`useChain`](https://www.react-spring.dev/docs/components/use-chain),
that is used in parallel with [`useSpringRef`](https://react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/spring-ref). (Hence the initial setup via the HOC architecture)

export function SimpleSpringTransitionAnimationController() {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(true);
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button onClick={() => setAnimate(!animate)}>{`click to ${
        animate ? "stop" : "start"
      } animation`}</button>
      <div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />
      <ReactSpringTransition preview={animate} />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

<SimpleSpringTransitionAnimationController />
