# Overview

## Motivation

We all have faced problems trying to build applications, be it setup issues or straight-up improper and incomplete
advice via a rabbit-hole of threads on various community forums.

Given the ever-increasing workload demands and decreasing time-span to solve problems, we are faced with significant challenges.

Hopefully this site, will help solve _some_ of your problems.

## What is this Site?

The goal of this site is to eliminate some of the everyday developer problems by providing in-depth explanations of the:

- What
- Where
- Why

of the <code>code</code> written, with valid links and examples wherever possible and required.

This set of **interactive** and **intuitive** _follow-alongs_ are meant to be of help to the community of developers,
trying to build applications using these technologies.

## Who am I?

Hi! I'm Gaurav Singh, a budding **Full Stack Developer.** <br/>
This guy tries to ask the _wrong questions_, ALL THE TIME (so that you don't have to)
