# Using react-spring

**react-spring** is a powerful react library that allows the user to create
_imperative_ animations, on the components the user wants to animate.

## Recipes

This is a recipe about how you can create an interactive react component using react-spring <br/>

### Recipe 1

- we're going to start small, by creating an orchestrated box, which translates in the x-axis, and has another box <br/>
  inside it, that shrinks and grows, as the box translates.

import ReactSpringTransition from "../../../src/components/react-transitions/component-transitions/ReactSpringTransition";

<ReactSpringTransition />
