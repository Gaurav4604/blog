# Recipe 5

import ListDropDown from "../../../../src/components/react-transitions/component-transitions/ReactSpringTransition/ListDropDown";
import { useState } from "react";

export function ListController() {
  const [initialList, setInitialList] = useState(["one", "two", "three"]);
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          const listA = ["one", "two", "three"];
          const listB = ["four", "five", "six"];
          if (initialList.includes("one")) {
            setInitialList(listB);
          } else {
            setInitialList(listA);
          }
        }}
      >
        reset list
      </button>
      <ListDropDown initialList={initialList} />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

<ListController />

## What we're going to be building

## Why Though?

We just built a cool dismissible list in the [_previous recipe_](./recipe-4), and surely you're thinking,
why Gaurav? why are we **rebuilding** our component again? Well, to that I say, open your web-inspector,
and take a **closer** look at the dom tree, doesn't it seem strange, that our list, which we _dismissed_,
still exists in the tree? <br/>
Now we're getting closer to the issue, as you see, `useSpring` is very powerful while building _UI_ centric animations,
and handling static data. _Sure_, with some smart logic, you can easily make it handle dynamic data as well, but according
to the [react-spring docs](https://react-spring.dev/docs) we have a better **API hook** provided by the library to help us elegantly handle dynamic
and complex lists of data.

## Hero of this Recipe

The `useTransition` api hook, is designed to elegantly handle **enter** and **exit** transitions for components based on dynamic list of data.
Essentially, **react-spring** lets us avoid _choppy behaviour_, while _mounting_ and _unmounting_ our components based on data.
