**react-spring** is a powerful react library that allows the user to create
_imperative_ animations, on the components the user wants to animate.

## Description

This is a set of recipes about how you can create an complex interactive react component using react-spring <br/>

## Recipes

### Recipe 1 (a box that slides around)

- we're going to start small, by creating an simple box, which translates in the x-axis (or slides around in th x-axis).

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: "link",
    href: "./recipe-1",
    label: "Recipe 1",
    description: "A box that slides around",
  }}
/>

### Recipe 2 (a box that shrinks and grows)

- for this one, we build on our existing knowledge, by creating a similar project,
  about a box that shrinks and grows

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: "link",
    href: "./recipe-2",
    label: "Recipe 2",
    description: "a box that shrinks and grows",
  }}
/>
