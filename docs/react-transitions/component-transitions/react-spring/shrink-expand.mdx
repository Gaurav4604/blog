import ShrinkGrow from "../../../../src/components/react-transitions/component-transitions/ReactSpringTransition/ShrinkGrow";
import { useState } from "react";

# Recipe 2

export function SimpleShrinkGrowAnimationController() {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(true);
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button onClick={() => setAnimate(!animate)}>{`click to ${
        animate ? "stop" : "start"
      } animation`}</button>
      <div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />
      <ShrinkGrow preview={animate} />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

## What we're gonna be building

<SimpleShrinkGrowAnimationController />

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />

## Code

```jsx
import { animated, useSpring } from "@react-spring/web";
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const ShrinkGrow = () => {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(true);

  const { scale } = useSpring({
    from: { scale: animate ? 0 : 1 },
    to: { scale: animate ? 1 : 0 },
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setAnimate(!animate);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    };
  }, [animate]);

  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        width: 80,
        background: "#ff6",
        height: 80,
        borderRadius: 8,
        scale,
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />

### Code Breakdown

As with [Recipe 1](./recipe-1#code-breakdown), our code can be divided into 3 sections

1. #### Animation _definition_

```jsx
const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(false);

const { scale } = useSpring({
  from: { scale: animate ? 0 : 1 },
  to: { translation: animate ? 1 : 0 },
});
```

- The controller follows the same logic as **Recipe 1**, except, we replace transition with **scale**, <br />
  and let our value range between _0_ and _1_. [know more
  here](./recipe-1#animation-definition)

2. #### Animation _control_

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    setAnimate(!animate);
  }, 1000);
  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
  };
}, [animate]);
```

- You must be starting to see a trend here, our animation controller looks very similar, <br/>
  to [Recipe 1 Animation Control](recipe-1#animation-control), this is because it is performing the **same action**,
  except on a _different_ style property of the element.

3. #### component _declaration_

```jsx
<animated.div
  style={{
    width: 80,
    background: "#ff6",
    height: 80,
    borderRadius: 8,
    scale,
  }}
/>
```

- like [Recipe 1 component declaration](recipe-1#component-declaration), we declare our component,
  and apply a different style property, **scale** onto it.<br/> Thus allowing for our component to Shrink and Grow!

## Conclusion

I hope that helps understand a _variation_, to apply
react-spring based value as style property to create an animated component.
Since this tutorial was very similar to [Recipe 1](./recipe-1), I have added links to the similar sections for help.
If you're clear with these, lets move on to making these components more reusable, using HOC architecture!
