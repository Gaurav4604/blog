# react-spring

import DocCard from "../../../../src/theme/DocCard";

**react-spring** is a powerful react library that allows the user to create
_imperative_ animations, on the components the user wants to animate. <br/>
It uses _spring physics_ for its animation configuration rather than _bezier-curves_, making it more intiutive to use.

## Introduction

This is a set of recipes about how you can create an complex interactive react component using react-spring <br/>
I'm going to assume you have knowledge about the following _React_ concepts.

- Function Components
- Hooks (useState, useEffect, customHooks)
- HOCs [(Friendly intro to HOC architecture)](https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-react-higher-order-components/)

### Environment Setup

Make sure you are using a React Application for these tutorials. <br/>
[Learn about setting up React Application](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/#creating-a-typescript-app)

Make sure to have installed the following libraries.

- [react-spring](https://react-spring.dev/)
- [@use-gesture/react](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/docs/state/)

Here's a shortcut for the same.

```bash
npm i react-spring @use-gesture/react
```

## Recipes

Each of the following recipes have

- Interactive Preview
- Code Section
- Code Breakdown
- Conclusion

### Recipe 1 (a box that slides around)

- we're going to start small, by creating an simple box, which translates in the x-axis (or slides around in th x-axis).

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: "link",
    href: "./recipe-1",
    label: "Recipe 1",
    description: "A box that slides around",
  }}
/>

### Recipe 2 (a box that shrinks and grows)

- for this one, we build on our existing knowledge, by creating a similar project,
  about a box that shrinks and grows

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: "link",
    href: "./recipe-2",
    label: "Recipe 2",
    description: "a box that shrinks and grows",
  }}
/>

### Recipe 3 (HOC architecture for react-spring components)

- here we apply an HOC architecture onto our components from [recipe 1](./recipe-1) and [recipe 2](./recipe-2),
  and showcase how to orchestrate multiple transitions with timing delay, without much additional configuration.

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: "link",
    href: "./recipe-3",
    label: "Recipe 3",
    description: "HOC architecture for react-spring components",
  }}
/>

### Recipe 4 (A list of swipe gesture based Dismissibles)

- reusing the logic from [recipe 1](./recipe-1) and [recipe 2](./recipe-2), we build further understanding of how powerful
  the react-spring library is, by using it along with @use-gesture/react, to build facinating swipe gesture based dismissibles list.

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: "link",
    href: "./recipe-4",
    label: "Recipe 4",
    description: "A list of swipe gesture based Dismissibles",
  }}
/>

NOTE: The recipes get increasingly interesting, and require more attention to understand
what's happening, please make sure you focus on them accordingly.
