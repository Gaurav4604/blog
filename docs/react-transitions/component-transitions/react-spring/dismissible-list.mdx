# (V) Dismissible List

import DismissibleList from "../../../../src/components/react-transitions/component-transitions/ReactSpringTransition/DismissibleList";
import { useState } from "react";

export function ListController() {
  const [initialList, setInitialList] = useState(["one", "two", "three"]);
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          const listA = ["one", "two", "three"];
          const listB = ["four", "five", "six"];
          if (initialList.includes("one")) {
            setInitialList(listB);
          } else {
            setInitialList(listA);
          }
        }}
      >
        reset list
      </button>
      <DismissibleList initialList={initialList} />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

<ListController />

## What we're going to be building

## Why Though?

We just built a cool dismissible list in the [_previous recipe_](./recipe-4), and surely you're thinking,
why Gaurav? why are we **rebuilding** our component again? Well, we're not, open your web-inspector,
and take a **closer** look at the dom tree, doesn't it seem strange, that our list, which we _dismissed_,
still exists in the tree? <br/>
Now we're getting closer to the issue, as you see, `useSpring` is very powerful while building _UI_ centric animations,
and handling static data. _Sure_, with some smart logic, you can easily make it handle dynamic data as well, but according
to the [react-spring docs](https://react-spring.dev/docs) we have a better **API hook** provided by the library to help us elegantly handle dynamic
and complex lists of data.

## Hero of this Recipe

The `useTransition` api hook, is designed to elegantly handle **enter** and **exit** transitions for components based on dynamic list of data.
Essentially, **react-spring** lets us avoid _choppy behaviour_, while _mounting_ and _unmounting_ our components based on data.

**NOTE**: We will use _some hacky solutions_ to make `useTransition` work according to our specifications.

## Code (Part 1)

```tsx
type Props = {
  onDismiss: () => void;
} & PropsWithChildren;

const Dismissible = (props: Props) => {
  const [spring, api] = useSpring(() => ({
    from: {
      x: 0,
      height: 80,
      scale: 0,
    },
    config: config.stiff,
  }));

  const bind = useDrag(
    ({ down, movement: [mx], velocity: [velocity], direction: [x] }) => {
      let flingIt = false;
      if (!down && velocity > 0.5 && x === 1) {
        flingIt = true;
      }

      api.start(() => {
        if (flingIt) {
          return {
            x: 400,
            height: 300,
            scale: 300,
            onResolve: props.onDismiss,
          };
        } else if (spring.x.get() >= 0) {
          return {
            x: down ? mx : 0,
            height: down ? mx : 80,
            scale: down ? mx : 0,
          };
        } else if (!down) {
          return {
            x: 0,
            height: 80,
            scale: 0,
          };
        }
      });
    }
  );

  const height = spring.height.to({
    map: Math.abs,
    range: [160, 280],
    output: [80, 0],
    extrapolate: "clamp",
  });

  const scale = spring.scale.to({
    map: Math.abs,
    range: [0, 280],
    output: [0, 1],
    extrapolate: "clamp",
  });

  const commonProps = {
    borderRadius: 10,
    touchAction: "none",
  };

  return (
    <animated.div
      {...bind()}
      style={{
        x: spring.x,
        height,
        width: 160,
        backgroundColor: "#ff6d6d",
        position: "relative",
        ...commonProps,
        marginBottom: "1rem",
      }}
    >
      <animated.div
        style={{
          height,
          width: 80,
          scale,
          backgroundColor: "#ff6",
          position: "absolute",
          display: "flex",
          alignItems: "center",
          justifyContent: "center",
          overflow: "hidden",
          ...commonProps,
        }}
      >
        <animated.div
          style={{
            scale,
            fontSize: "2rem",
            color: "black",
          }}
        >
          {props.children}
        </animated.div>
      </animated.div>
    </animated.div>
  );
};
export default Dismissible;
```

### Code Breakdown

1. #### Finding the similarities:

   This code, looks quite similar to the [Dismissible](./recipe-4), we just built. So then, what's changed?
   If you take a look at the code, you will see, we're using `useSpring` instead of `useSprings`, since now, our **goal**, is to make a reusable, _atomic_
   dismissible, and we're remdering a single component, instead of a component array.

2. #### Logic Required for Reusability

   Since the only goal of our component is to be _dismissed_, we add a `onDismiss` callback handler to the props.
   We will discuss **when** and **where** to _fire_ this callback down below.

   ```tsx
   type Props = {
     onDismiss: () => void; // <--- this
   } & PropsWithChildren;
   ```

3. #### Handling the Dismiss Action UI state

   In [Recipe 4](./recipe-4) we wanted to track state of _dismiss action triggered_ across the component, and thus we used `useState` to keep track of the same.
   In the current case though, we simply need to know about _dismiss action triggered_ , over the course of the **callback function inside `drag` handle**.
   We've used a simple flag, aptly named `flingIt`. That is set to `true`, if the user _flings_ the dismissible.

   ```tsx
   let flingIt = false; // <--- this
   if (!down && velocity > 0.5 && x === 1) {
     flingIt = true;
   }
   ```

4. #### Handling the Dismiss Action Callback

   The other major change, that might not be very visible to the eye, is when we've fired our `onDismiss` callback. This last but not the least, change is very important
   in explaining how **react-spring** actually handles animations and why it is said to be an _optimised way to handle animations_. <br/>
   As you can see, we're firing our `onDismiss` callback, `onResolve` of the animation. This is because, the animation controllers are _async_ in nature, and **do not block**
   the main code execution. Since `async` functions are _Promises_, they need to be `rejected` or `resolved`, in order for the _main thread_ to take notice.

   ```tsx
   if (flingIt) {
     return {
       x: 400,
       height: 300,
       scale: 300,
       onResolve: props.onDismiss, // <--- this
     };
   }
   ```

## Conclusion (Part 1)

That about explains the changes we have made, to the `Dismissible` to make it more reusable.
There are a few other changes done as well, but you should be able to easily grasp them, since we have
covered all of the same in previous recipes. You can find the list of the same [here](../react-spring#recipes).
Lets now move onto the `useTransition` hook for the actual list rendering.

## Code (Part 2)

```tsx
type Props = {
  initialList: string[];
};
const DismissibleList = (props: Props) => {
  const [list, setList] = useState<string[]>([]);

  const [transitions, api] = useTransition(
    list,
    () => ({
      from: { maxHeight: 0 },
      enter: { maxHeight: 80 },
      leave: { maxHeight: 0 },
      trail: 200 / list.length,
      config: config.stiff,
    }),
    [list.length]
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    api.start();
  }, [list.length]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setList([]);
    setTimeout(() => {
      setList(props.initialList);
    });
  }, [props.initialList]);

  return transitions((styles, item) => (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        ...styles,
        marginBottom: styles.maxHeight.to({
          map: Math.abs,
          range: [0, 80],
          output: [0, 10],
          extrapolate: "clamp",
        }),
      }}
      key={item}
    >
      <Dismissible
        onDismiss={() => {
          setList((list) => list.filter((itm) => itm !== item));
        }}
      >
        {item}
      </Dismissible>
    </animated.div>
  ));
};

export default DismissibleList;
```

### Code Breakdown

1. #### Definition Enter/Exit Transitions and Component State

   As you can see in the code-block below, we're defining an internal state for a list, for `useTransition` hook to use. You might ask, _why is this important?_
   The answer lies, in how useTransition tracks list data, since we want to be able to **replace** and **reuse** our component, more than once, we need to show
   `useTransition`, that our list at some point will be **empty**, and **_only then, new data will be accepted by the `useTransition` hook._ **(This is part 1 of our hack for reusable list)

   We're also defining parameters for the `useTransition` hook:

   1. We've seen `from` be used before in previous recipes, this parameter is simply used to define the initial state of the **list-item**
   2. `enter` is `useTransition`'s equivalent to `to` in `useSpring`, it is the state, onto which the list-item will transition to.
   3. `leave` is a special parameter `useTransition` uses to **_unmount_** a _list-item_ from the **DOM tree** with a _transition_.
   4. `trail` is also a special parameter, which allows _delay_ to be introduced, during the _mounting_ of **list-item**.
   5. We've seen `config` be used before, it allows our defined transitions to use _spring_ physics. <br/><br/>

   ```tsx
   const [list, setList] = useState<string[]>([]);

   const [transitions, api] = useTransition(
     list,
     () => ({
       from: { maxHeight: 0 },
       enter: { maxHeight: 80 },
       leave: { maxHeight: 0 },
       trail: 200 / list.length,
       config: config.stiff,
     }),
     [list.length]
   );
   ```

2. #### Data Input and Animation Trigger

   This one's all about how we use _side effects_ to achieve a _smooth list lifecycle_.

   1. Our first `useEffect` is used to trigger the `useTransition` **api**
      to start the animation process on the `list` anytime there's changes to the list length.

   2. The second `useEffect` is the hacky `useEffect`, this one is used to tell `useTransition` hook, that the list has been **cleared**, _so it should
      replace, the list data it tracks internally_, with new data, provided by the **state**.

   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     api.start();
   }, [list.length]);

   useEffect(() => {
     setList([]);
     setTimeout(() => {
       setList(props.initialList);
     });
   }, [props.initialList]);
   ```

3. #### Component Rendering

   The component render, is pretty similar to how `useSprings` wants components to be rendered, **except** that `useTransition` actually wants us to render **the same component**
   as a _list_, thus it takes creates a function api for us to use, which takes our _list-item JSX as function parameter_.

   ```tsx
   return transitions((styles, item) => (
     <animated.div
       style={{
         ...styles,
         marginBottom: styles.maxHeight.to({
           map: Math.abs,
           range: [0, 80],
           output: [0, 10],
           extrapolate: "clamp",
         }),
       }}
       key={item}
     >
       <Dismissible
         onDismiss={() => {
           setList((list) => list.filter((itm) => itm !== item));
         }}
       >
         {item}
       </Dismissible>
     </animated.div>
   ));
   ```

## Conclusion (Part 2)

Phew! That was a lot of information! I hope you found it useful, this is us barely scratching the surface with the potential of `react-spring` as
a animation library for `React`. There's a lot more you can do, but most of the components you will build, will end up using this core logic, thus make
sure to use this as a reference while building your projects! Cheers!
