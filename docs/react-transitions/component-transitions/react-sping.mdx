# Using react-spring

**react-spring** is a powerful react library that allows the user to create
_imperative_ animations, on the components the user wants to animate.

## Description

This is a set of recipes about how you can create an complex interactive react component using react-spring <br/>

## Recipes

### Recipe 1 (a box that slides around)

- we're going to start small, by creating an simple box, which translates in the x-axis (or slides around in th x-axis).

import SlideAround from "../../../src/components/react-transitions/component-transitions/ReactSpringTransition/SlideAround";
import { useState } from "react";

```jsx
import { animated, useSpring } from "@react-spring/web";
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const SlideAround = () => {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(false);

  const { translation } = useSpring({
    from: { translation: animate ? 0 : 100 },
    to: { translation: animate ? 100 : 0 },
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setAnimate(!animate);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    };
  }, [animate]);

  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        width: 80,
        background: "#ff6d6d",
        height: 80,
        borderRadius: 8,
        x: translation,
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

export const SimpleSlideAnimationController = () => {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setAnimate(!animate)}>{`click to ${
        animate ? "stop" : "start"
      } animation`}</button>
      <div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />
      <SlideAround preview={animate} />
    </>
  );
};

<SimpleSlideAnimationController />

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />

#### Code Breakdown

- The above code can be divided into 3 sections

  1. Animation _definition_

  ```jsx
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(false);

  const { translation } = useSpring({
    from: { translation: animate ? 0 : 100 },
    to: { translation: animate ? 100 : 0 },
  });
  ```

  - _react-spring_ provides a `useSpring` hook, which is a animation controller of sorts.

  - it provides configuration of variety of parameters, but to keep things simple,
    we will use the `to` and `from` parameters for setting-up an **initial** and **final**
    position for our _animation_ and let **react-spring** take care of the rest.

  - with a mutable state variable, we will tell _react-spring_ that we want to either move from **0** to **100**
    _or_ move from **100** to **0** based on what the `animate` variable is set to, where 0 and 100 refer to the **_transform_ ** value in CSS.

  - notice how we're destructuring `translation` from the `useSpring` hook, this is because,
    useSpring is actually computing a realtime value for us, based on our `to` and `from` parameters,
    on, the `translation` _key_ of the **object** <br/>
    (NOTE: this key can be anything that the user specifies). <br/> This key is then returned to us, by the `useSpring` hook, in the form
    of a continuously changing value.

  2. Animation _control_

  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setAnimate(!animate);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    };
  }, [animate]);
  ```

  - This code block is simply meant to trigger the animation every 1 second.

  - By calling `setAnimate`, with a `true` or `false` **alternatively**, we force our `useSpring` hook, to return us a value <br/>
    that triggers animation, between the _to_ and _from_ specified.

  3. component _declaration_

  ```jsx
  <animated.div
    style={{
      width: 80,
      background: "#ff6d6d",
      height: 80,
      borderRadius: 8,
      x: translation,
    }}
  />
  ```

  - finally, we simply apply the _transformation_ (stored on `transition` variable) onto our _animated component_, in the axis we want the component to translate along.

  - we use the `animated.div` component provided by **react-spring** library, as it consumes the provided transformation,
    via the `useSpring` hook, and tries to apply a valid animation onto
    the specified style property (in our case, the "x" value) without us needing to _configure_ anything.
