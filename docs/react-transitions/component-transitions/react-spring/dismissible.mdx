# Recipe 4

import DismissibleExample from "../../../../src/components/react-transitions/component-transitions/ReactSpringTransition/DismissibleExample";

## What we're going to be building

(hint: Dismissibles!)

<DismissibleExample />

## Code

```tsx
const Dismissible = () => {
  const [springs, api] = useSprings(2, () => ({
    x: 0,
    height: 80,
    scale: 0,
    config: config.stiff,
  }));

  const [flung] = useState(() => new Set<number>());

  const bind = useDrag(
    ({ args: [index], down, movement: [mx], velocity: [velocity] }) => {
      if (!down && velocity > 1) flung.add(index);
      api.start((i) => {
        if (flung.has(i)) {
          return {
            x: 400,
            height: 300,
            scale: 300,
          };
        }
        if (!flung.has(i) && i === index && springs[i].x.get() >= 0) {
          return {
            x: down ? mx : 0,
            height: down ? mx : 80,
            scale: down ? mx : 0,
          };
        } else if (!down) {
          return {
            x: 0,
            height: 80,
            scale: 0,
          };
        }
      });
      if (flung.size === 2 && !down) {
        setTimeout(() => {
          api.start((i) => ({
            height: 80,
            x: 0,
            scale: 0,
            delay: i === 1 ? 500 : 0,
          }));
          flung.clear();
        }, 600);
      }
    }
  );

  return (
    <>
      {springs.map((props, index) => {
        const height = props.height.to({
          map: Math.abs,
          range: [160, 280],
          output: [80, 0],
          extrapolate: "clamp",
        });

        const commonProps = {
          borderRadius: 10,
          touchAction: "none",
          marginBottom: 10,
        };

        return (
          <animated.div
            key={index}
            {...bind(index)}
            style={{
              x: props.x,
              height,
              width: 160,
              backgroundColor: index ? "#ff6" : "#ff6d6d",
              position: "relative",
              ...commonProps,
            }}
          >
            <animated.div
              style={{
                height,
                width: 80,
                scale: props.scale.to({
                  map: Math.abs,
                  range: [0, 280],
                  output: [0, 1],
                  extrapolate: "clamp",
                }),
                backgroundColor: index ? "#ff6d6d" : "#ff6",
                position: "absolute",
                ...commonProps,
              }}
            />
          </animated.div>
        );
      })}
    </>
  );
};
```

### Code Breakdown

I know your first thoughts will be, "Woah! that's a lot of code",
you're not wrong, but we're gonna go over it step by step. We're gonna use **react-spring**
with **@use-gesture/react**
(a gesture recognition library by the amazing developer who created react-spring).

1. #### Animation _definition_

```tsx
const [springs, api] = useSprings(2, () => ({
  x: 0,
  height: 80,
  scale: 0,
  config: config.stiff,
}));
```

You will notice, we've used `useSprings` instead of `useSpring`, since this better suits
our use-case. `usSprings` is meant to handle an **array** of components that have the same _animation_
configuration. In our case, we will be using 2 array items for our dismissibles.

This time, we're using same configuration to animate multiple properties of components, such as

- x
- height
- scale

These properties will be applied to the components same as we have been doing in [recipe 1](./recipe-1) and [recipe 2](./recipe-2).

**But**, You might have noticed, our list items have a **springy effect** on them when we release them after sliding,
This is because of a property, `config`, config controls how the component value changes behave, similar to **bezier-curve**,
except relying on **_spring physics_** instead. In our case we have assigned assigned `config` a value of `config.stiff`. This is because **react-spring**
is meant to mimic (you guessed it) **springs**.<br/>
NOTE: The config object is an _animation config preset_ object provided and imported from **react-spring** library. <br/>
[Learn more about spring config here](https://react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/config).

2. #### Animation _control_ (Part 1)

```tsx
const [flung] = useState(() => new Set<number>());

const bind = useDrag(
  ({ args: [index], down, movement: [mx], velocity: [velocity] }) => {
    if (!down && velocity > 1) flung.add(index);
    api.start((i) => {
      if (flung.has(i)) {
        return {
          x: 400,
          height: 300,
          scale: 300,
        };
      }
      if (!flung.has(i) && i === index && springs[i].x.get() >= 0) {
        return {
          x: down ? mx : 0,
          height: down ? mx : 80,
          scale: down ? mx : 0,
        };
      } else if (!down) {
        return {
          x: 0,
          height: 80,
          scale: 0,
        };
      }
    });
    if (flung.size === 2 && !down) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        api.start((i) => ({
          height: 80,
          x: 0,
          scale: 0,
          delay: i === 1 ? 500 : 0,
        }));
        flung.clear();
      }, 600);
    }
  }
);
```

A lot of the code here looks new, right? Indeed!
A summary of this code section would be,

- tracking of state on the **dismissibles**
- action to be taken based on user's behaviour via a gesture
- actual output definition, using the `api` handler
- reset of state once list items are _flung_

Now, lets expand upon the points we discussed during summarization of the section.

1. ##### State Tracking

```tsx
const [flung] = useState(() => new Set<number>());
```

We're using a `Set` _data-structure_ to hold our state, for **dismissed indexes**, since the dismiss action should be recorded only once,
we use a `Set`, as it only store **unique** values. We name it **flung** (since we're trying to _fling away_ our dismissibles).

2. ##### Gesture Based Actions

```tsx
const bind = useDrag(
  ({ args: [index], down, movement: [mx], velocity: [velocity] }) => {
    if (!down && velocity > 1) flung.add(index);
  }
);
```

Our `useDrag` hook is a handler to returns `ReactDOMAttributes`, this means we can directed use the `bind` function inside the JSX elements which _support_
**ReactDOMAttributes**, this is how **@use-gesture/react** is able to track gestures on the elements.

`useDrag` gives us a lot of data about the **gesture**, to define exactly what we want to do, once the **gesture** is _triggered_. In our use-case, we
want to know about the,

- movement
- velocity
- if user is currently interacting with element (via `down` parameter)

of the gesture in **on the x-axis**, <br/>
Since, `bind` is a function that will be common across all list items, we need a way to identify which list item is being interacted with, we're doing
this by passing our **list-item index** to `bind` when calling the function. <br/>
[Learn more about what properties are available on the useDrag hook here.](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/docs/state/)

With these things defined, we check, if the user is currently interacting with the element, if not, and if the element is flung with a **velocity >= 1**,
we consider the element to be dismissed, thus adding this index to the `flung` Set.

3. ##### Output using _react-spring_

```tsx
api.start((i) => {
  if (flung.has(i)) {
    return {
      x: 400,
      height: 300,
      scale: 300,
    };
  }
  if (!flung.has(i) && i === index && springs[i].x.get() >= 0) {
    return {
      x: down ? mx : 0,
      height: down ? mx : 80,
      scale: down ? mx : 0,
    };
  } else if (!down) {
    return {
      x: 0,
      height: 80,
      scale: 0,
    };
  }
});
```

The `api` handler is an imperative api for triggering **react-spring** transitions. It triggers a transition based on the **config** provided.
In our case, we want to trigger different transitions based on the index of the list item.

- Case 1 (when the list item exists in the **flung** Set)

  ```tsx
  if (flung.has(i)) {
    return {
      x: 400,
      height: 300,
      scale: 300,
    };
  }
  ```

  We return a config with these values (more on the values later), flinging off the list item.

- Case 2 (when the list item is interacted upon by grabbing and moving it)

  ```tsx
  if (!flung.has(i) && i === index && springs[i].x.get() >= 0) {
    return {
      x: down ? mx : 0,
      height: down ? mx : 80,
      scale: down ? mx : 0,
    };
  }
  ```

  We check if the user is interacting with an item, not present in the `flung` Set, if so, and he is interacting with the
  element in the **positive x-axis**, we apply the movement value onto the element's transition values.

- Case 3 (when the user releases the grabbed item)

  ```tsx
  else if (!down) {
    return {
      x: 0,
      height: 80,
      scale: 0,
    };
  }
  ```

  We already have a conditional `down ? mx : 0` statement that we use, in **case 2**, so why this? this is just a clean-up for the _side-effects_
  of **case 1**, so that even if the user _flings_ the element, but doesn't release it, we should reset the value.

4. ##### State Reset

```tsx
if (flung.size === 2 && !down) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    api.start((i) => ({
      height: 80,
      x: 0,
      scale: 0,
      delay: i === 1 ? 500 : 0,
    }));
    flung.clear();
  }, 600);
}
```

We simply check if our `flung` Set is full, and user is not currently interacting with the list, if that's the case
then we reset the state of list items (after a delay of 600ms).

3. #### Animation _control_ and Component declaration (Part 2)

```tsx
return (
  <>
    {springs.map((props, index) => {
      const height = props.height.to({
        map: Math.abs,
        range: [160, 280],
        output: [80, 0],
        extrapolate: "clamp",
      });

      const commonProps = {
        borderRadius: 10,
        touchAction: "none",
        marginBottom: 10,
      };

      return (
        <animated.div
          key={index}
          {...bind(index)}
          style={{
            x: props.x,
            height,
            width: 160,
            backgroundColor: index ? "#ff6" : "#ff6d6d",
            position: "relative",
            ...commonProps,
          }}
        >
          <animated.div
            style={{
              height,
              width: 80,
              scale: props.scale.to({
                map: Math.abs,
                range: [0, 280],
                output: [0, 1],
                extrapolate: "clamp",
              }),
              backgroundColor: index ? "#ff6d6d" : "#ff6",
              position: "absolute",
              ...commonProps,
            }}
          />
        </animated.div>
      );
    })}
  </>
);
```

This code section seems large but is quite simple, we simply apply our `useDrag` hook handler onto the actual JSX. Along with that we're **interpolating**
our animation values, onto values we actually want the component to display.

Example:

```tsx
props.scale.to({
  map: Math.abs,
  range: [0, 280],
  output: [0, 1],
  extrapolate: "clamp",
});
```

Here we're defining input range to be between 0 - 200, and output range to be 0 - 1. The mapping function for value is `Math.abs`, to use the _absolute_
input value. `extrapolate` is used to tell the component what to do, once we exceed the given input range. <br/>
[Learn more about interpolation here.](https://react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/interpolation)

All other properties are exactly the same as we have used before in [recipe 1](./recipe-1) and [recipe 2](./recipe-2).

## Conclusion

Phew! That was a lot of code and explanation, we covered a lot of concepts in this section, mainly,

- useSprings hook
- spring config
- react-spring api based imperative animation triggers
- interpolation
- a bit about gesture control using @use-gesture/react

This tutorial further elaborates how powerful react-spring is, in defining complex animations
on components. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and that this was informative.
