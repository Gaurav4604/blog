import SlideAround from "../../../../src/components/react-transitions/component-transitions/ReactSpringTransition/SlideAround";
import { useState } from "react";

# Recipe 1

export function SimpleSlideAnimationController() {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(true);
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button onClick={() => setAnimate(!animate)}>{`click to ${
        animate ? "stop" : "start"
      } animation`}</button>
      <div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />
      <SlideAround preview={animate} />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

## What we're gonna be building

<SimpleSlideAnimationController />

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />

## Code

```jsx
import { animated, useSpring } from "@react-spring/web";
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const SlideAround = () => {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(false);

  const { translation } = useSpring({
    from: { translation: animate ? 0 : 100 },
    to: { translation: animate ? 100 : 0 },
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setAnimate(!animate);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    };
  }, [animate]);

  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        width: 80,
        background: "#ff6d6d",
        height: 80,
        borderRadius: 8,
        x: translation,
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />

### Code Breakdown

The above code can be divided into 3 sections

1. #### Animation _definition_

```jsx
const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(false);

const { translation } = useSpring({
  from: { translation: animate ? 0 : 100 },
  to: { translation: animate ? 100 : 0 },
});
```

- _react-spring_ provides a `useSpring` hook, which is a animation controller of sorts.

- it provides configuration of variety of parameters, but to keep things simple,
  we will use the `to` and `from` parameters for setting-up an **initial** and **final**
  position for our _animation_ and let **react-spring** take care of the rest.

- with a mutable state variable, we will tell _react-spring_ that we want to either move from **0** to **100**
  _or_ move from **100** to **0** based on what the `animate` variable is set to, where 0 and 100 refer to the range between which we will apply our **transform _translate_ ** value in CSS.<br/>
  (NOTE: this is done via the animated component, by react-spring, as mentioned below)

- notice how we're destructuring `translation` from the `useSpring` hook, this is because,
  useSpring is actually computing a realtime value for us, based on our `to` and `from` parameters,
  on, the `translation` _key_ of the **object** <br/>
  (NOTE: this key can be anything that the user specifies). <br/> This key is then returned to us, by the `useSpring` hook, in the form
  of a continuously changing (_animating_) value. <br/>

2. #### Animation _control_

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    setAnimate(!animate);
  }, 1000);
  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
  };
}, [animate]);
```

- This code block is simply meant to trigger the animation every 1 second.

- By calling `setAnimate`, with a `true` or `false` **alternatively**, we force our `useSpring` hook, to return us a value <br/>
  that triggers animation, between the _to_ and _from_ specified.

3. #### component _declaration_

```jsx
<animated.div
  style={{
    width: 80,
    background: "#ff6d6d",
    height: 80,
    borderRadius: 8,
    x: translation,
  }}
/>
```

- finally, we simply apply the _transformation_ (stored on `transition` variable) onto our _animated component_, in the axis we want the component to translate along.

- we use the `animated.div` component provided by **react-spring** library, as it consumes the provided transformation,
  via the `useSpring` hook, and tries to apply a valid animation onto
  the specified style property.<br />
  In our case, we use the the `x` property, as it refers to the `translate` property
  in CSS, for x-axis.<br/> (NOTE: this interpretation is done by react-spring automatically)<br />

## Conclusion

I hope that cleared up the basics of working with react-spring, if so, lets move onto the next tutorial, where we make a box
shrink and expand!
